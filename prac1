Step 1: Update Packages and Install DHCP Server
First, need to update the list of available software and then install the ISC DHCP Server. The apt-get
update command ensures you get the latest package information, and apt install handles the
installation. sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install isc-dhcp-server
Step 2: Configure the Network Interface
Next, edit the configuration file to tell the DHCP server which network interface it should listen on for
requests. In my case, this is the ens33 interface. sudo nano /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
Inside the file, change INTERFACESv4="" to INTERFACESv4="ens33" Step 3: Configure the Main DHCP Settings
This step involves editing the main configuration file to set up your network's specific details, such as
the IP address range, router, and DNS servers. sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf ï‚· find and uncomment the following line:
authoritative;
Add or edit a subnet block that matches your network. Here is a common example you can adapt. subnet 192.168.234.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
range 192.168.234.100 192.168.234.200;
option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4;
option routers 192.168.234.2;
option broadcast-address 192.168.234.255;
default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;
}
Step 4: Restart and Verify the Service
After saving the configuration changes, must restart the DHCP service for the changes to take effect. Then, check its status to make sure it's running correctly. sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server
sudo systemctl status isc-dhcp-server
Step 5: Check Firewall Status
check firewall status to ensure it's not blocking the DHCP service. sudo ufw status
